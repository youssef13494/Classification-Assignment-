# Classification-Assignment
# Description:

•	You will be given a dataset for diabetes dataset, the data includes features such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. This data used to predict diabetes in patients based on their medical history and demographic information.

•	For this assignment you are being asked to apply the Bayesian classifier and decision tree classifier to identifying patients who may be at risk of developing diabetes.

•	The class label is diabetes which is the last column in the provided comma separated file.

# Requirements:
1.	Apply the Bayesian and Decision Tree algorithms to build two classifier model, using the “Training set”. 
2.	Then apply the two classifier models on the “Testing data set” to calculate the accuracy of the classifiers.
3.	Compare the results of the 2 classifiers: Bayesian and Decision tree.
